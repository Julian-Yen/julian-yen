Thousands of visitors from nearby or overseas. Clam into the day. Regardless of what they come for, the sound the signature waterfall can calm people down, with its almost white-noise like texture. <br> On each morning and afternoon, the monks lead a scripture reciting session. The recurring, monotounous sound of the monks blend with the less in sync recitations by other worshippers, no one else would speak a word. <br> In other moments, people socialize, pray and throw divination blocks to seek answer from the above. Every other 5 minutes, the sound of somebody tossing fortune sticks comes up as long, thin sticks colliding with each other in the container. </h3> </article> <div class="player"> <iframe class="templeplay" width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1038240772&color=%23161714&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe> </div> </div> <div class="park"> <article> <h2>艋舺公園</h2> <h1>Banga Park</h1> <br> <h3 id="parktext">Right across from the temple facing guangzhou street is Bangka Park. It was designed to synergize with Longshan Temple, and together revitalize the district's atmosphere and attractiveness. Before long, it became one of few gathering spots for the homeless population in Taipei City. Though some might find it dangerous or unpleasant, the park is in fact bustling with activities that attract people from all walks of life. During day time, people come and play chess, chat and (very enthusiastically) talk about which lottery number to go for. Some buy food and drinks from nearby and stay for the entire day. Others walk around and greet familiar faces in each part of the park. From the afternoon, a water show takes place in the central plaza every hour. </h3> </article> <div class="parkplay player"> <iframe class="parkplay" width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1038240844&color=%23161714&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe> </div> </div> </div> <div class="underground" id="sectionId"> <article> <h2>龍山地下街</h2> <h1>Long Shan Underground Shopping Street</h1> <br> <h3 id="ugtext">Right below the park is the Longshan Metro Station and the shopping street. Instead of luxury brands or gourmet food, the shopping street hosts a multitude of other businesses: fortune tellers, massage spots, tea shops and religious supply. The two tea shops are frequented by the homeless population in the park, as it serves cheap fruits and drink but offers air-conditioned seats to rest and socialize. One of the shops is often visited by a group of people with hearing impairment. While it might sound like nothing's going on, they engage in heated debates through hand gestures. Where sunlight does not travel, time flows differently. Day and night becomes blurred in the underground, and the soundscape also continues without much change, until the shops close down late into the night. </h3> </article> <div class="b1play player"> <iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1038240796&color=%23161714&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"> </iframe> </div> </div> <div class="b2" id="sectionId"> <article> <h2>龍山文創基地</h2> <h1>Long Shan B2</h1> <br> <h3 id="b2text">Longshan B2 is a space in-between. It used to be an extension of B1's locally-oriented business functions. After handing over to the department of cultural affairs three years ago, it is now a testing ground of a diverse, but somewhat scattered group of cultural industries: Tea art, Taiwanese Manga, Heritage restoration workshop, garment store, music livehouse all take a spot in the spacious site. But on an average day, not much people come to visit despite its accessibility. One corner of B2 has recently become a base for young breakdancers and dance instructors to practice their skills. The occasional dance battles attract young talents down in B2, the echoic underground fills up with energetic music and passionate cheers.</h3> </article> <div class="b2play player"> <iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1038240820&color=%23161714&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe> </div> </div> <div class="before"> <h2 class="beforetext">The sound snippets below are arranged according to the time and location of recording.
